This Java application was created which combined the features of two sample open source applications.  The first created a Client application which connected with a websocket server, sent an initial message and then instantly responded to any message received (Jiji_Sasidharan, 2013).  The second enabled a user defined amount of clients to connect to the websocket server and then randomly loop through these clients sending messages, which the server would then broadcast to the other connected clients (Webtide, 2011), whilst the second application appeared to do exactly what I was looking for, it proved to be too difficult to implement due to unreliable dependencies, however the desired functionality was achieved by a creating a new hybrid application incorporating the essential elements of both.
